# Arduino Experiments
Some Arduino Sketch from testing things.

Just got myself an Arduino Uno board and I'm testing various things.
See for example:
   - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJx5bWThhO8 - Light and sound feedback from ultrasound distance range finder - https://github.com/mdaquin/arduino_experiments/blob/master/ultrasound_RGB_led_noise
   - Displaying the distance in centimeters on a blinary led display from the ultrasonic range finder.
